## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a simple programming language using the Lex (Flex) and Yacc (Bison) compiler-generating tools.

- Variable and constant declarations
- Mathematical and logical expressions
- Assignment statements
- Control flow statements (if-then-else, while loops, for loops, switch statements)
- Block structures with nested scopes
- Functions

The project is divided into two phases:
- **Phase I**: Implement the lexical analyzer (lexer) and parser.
- **Phase II**: Extend the implementation with a symbol table, quadruple generation, syntax error handling, and basic semantic analysis.

I will focus on the current progress in **Phase I** and the what is still missing and needs to be implemented.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Flex (Lex)**: Generates the lexical analyzer.
- **Bison (Yacc)**: Generates the parser.
- **C**: The implementation language for both the lexer and parser.
- **GCC/G++**: Compiler used to build the project.

### 1. Lexical Analyzer (Lexer)
### 2. Parser

## Running Parser

on windows just run `build.bat`. it runs 5 test files in `/test` directory.
```bash
.\build.bat
```
